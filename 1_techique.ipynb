I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "Speech:The speech is the departing speech of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, after completing his five-year term. He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences during his tenure. He highlights 10 important messages that he wants to convey, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agricultural growth\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage\n",
      "6. Using connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "7. Defending the nation with pride\n",
      "8. Promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He specifically recalls a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He appreciated her question and assured her that it was a thoughtful one, implying that he believes India can achieve this goal with collective effort. The speech is a reflection on his time in office and a call to action for the people of India to work together towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken seriously and considered at the highest national level, with a commitment to work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and youth to achieve a prosperous and developed India. The speaker reflects on their experiences visiting villages, such as Nagaland, and highlights the potential for transformation when villages are empowered to drive their own development. They also mention initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology's PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to rural areas, leading to economic growth and employment opportunities. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Empowering villages to drive their own development\n",
      "* Providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to rural areas\n",
      "* Fostering economic growth and employment opportunities\n",
      "* Harnessing the aspirations of youth to build a prosperous and proud India\n",
      "* Initiatives like PURA can transform rural areas and create large-scale employment opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the help of self-help groups. The project has developed waste land into cultivable land, promoting sustainable economic development through activities like cultivation, bio-mass power generation, and food processing. Additionally, the project has collaborated with Japanese experts to develop 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the local people. The speaker suggests that this model can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 similar projects across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with farmers and agricultural scientists, highlighting the importance of agriculture in the nation's economy. The speaker shares their interaction with over 6,000 farmers who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan and showed interest in various gardens and horticultural specialties. The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with limited resources and improve the economic conditions of farmers through the \"Seed to Food\" principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also shifts to a personal anecdote about meeting a disabled person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite being born without hands and legs, was confident and happy. The speaker is inspired by Krishna Murthy's positive attitude and his desire to sing, which is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is one of hope and empowerment, encouraging individuals to overcome challenges and work together to achieve growth and success, particularly in the agricultural sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two inspiring stories of overcoming challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite their limitations, has developed a remarkable talent for music with the support of their parents, teachers, and others. This person's positive attitude and perseverance have enabled them to blossom as a musician, even performing at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and was impressed by the courage and resilience of the people, who had become masters of their problems rather than being controlled by them. The speaker appreciates the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and support to the villagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is one of hope and inspiration, highlighting the importance of a positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker mentions two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A visit to a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces, and witnessed the distribution of relief grants to victims.\n",
      "2. A visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met with tribal council leaders and were touched by the community's courage and generosity in taking care of affected victims, including orphans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a poem they composed, called \"Sea Waves\", which they sang with the villagers, and notes the enthusiasm and courage exhibited by the community despite their suffering. The speech also briefly mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but does not elaborate on this point. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of courage and community in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the \"Pan African e-Network\" project, which aims to connect 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project will link:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 in India, 5 in Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 in India, 5 in Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students, and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a prominent Indian leader, possibly a President or Prime Minister. The speech covers three main topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India's collaboration with Africa**: The speaker mentions India's experience in using technology to benefit society and how it is being shared with Africa to bring about transformation on the continent. Specifically, they mention a tele-consultation program between Hyderabad and a hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, having had personal experiences with the army, navy, and air force. They highlight the sacrifices and dedication of soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who work tirelessly to protect the nation, even in challenging circumstances.\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for a developed India**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\". The goal is to develop India by 2020, and the speaker seems to be encouraging and supporting this initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes India's global collaborations, national pride, and commitment to development and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become responsible and disciplined individuals. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who was inspired to help her father quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp. The speech concludes by emphasizing the need to empower the 540 million youth in India through value-based education and leadership, and expresses optimism about the country's future with its rich cultural diversity and unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while striving for economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the country's hardworking people, particularly its 540 million youth. The speaker highlights the need for empowering members of society and reducing the rural-urban divide. The speech concludes with a call to action, resolving to work towards a developed India by 2020, with key goals including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Ensuring equitable access to energy and water\n",
      "* Promoting harmony between agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "* Providing education with a value system to all meritorious candidates\n",
      "* Becoming a destination for top talent from around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is optimistic and inspiring, encouraging citizens to work together to build a better future for India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes a vision for a ideal nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Good governance that is transparent and corruption-free\n",
      "* Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A society where everyone feels included and valued\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, where he:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Thanks citizens for their love and support over the last 5 years\n",
      "* Shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society and instill self-confidence\n",
      "* Expresses his commitment to helping India become a developed nation before 2020\n",
      "* Ends with a blessing and a patriotic note, \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",

He highlights the importance of village empowerment, citing his experience in Nagaland, where he witnessed a prosperous village with a functioning village council, and notes the need for physical connectivity to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets. Additionally, he mentions initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's PURA complex, which provides urban amenities in rural areas, generates employment, and creates entrepreneurs, with notable successes including the development of 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, and the creation of sustainable economic development models through activities such as cultivation, power generation, and food processing. The PURA complex has also enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, with the support of experts from the Japan External Trade Organisation, demonstrating the potential for innovative and cooperative ventures to enhance the economic prospects of rural areas. He emphasizes the need for 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide, further emphasizing the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages. Furthermore, Kalam envisions empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, recognizing the 540 million youth below the age of 25 as the most powerful resource for the country's development. Initiatives like the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which trains students in partnership with district administrations, have shown positive impacts on students, such as increased self-discipline and a sense of duty towards the nation, giving assurance that the youth are on the right path to contribute to India's development.\n",
